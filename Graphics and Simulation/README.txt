Thanks for reading this file!

Many of the project ideas in here were chosen by browsing blog posts, looking through Coding Train thumbnails, etc. I want to make sure this is known so people don't think I am attempting to stockpile other's ideas as my own. I just find reproducing effects and algorithms others have done overview of quite interesting. This allows me to see how others have tackled the same problem and compare what I have improved on or perhaps failed to notice.

Please enjoy what I have created and feel free to use them for whatever purpose you see fit!
