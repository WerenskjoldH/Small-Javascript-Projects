Thanks for reading this file!

First off, glMatrix is not my own library! 
Please look for more information on that: http://glmatrix.net/
glMatrix Repo: https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix

Secondly, the projects in the "Review" folder were created while following various online WebGL resources. The primary of which are as follows:
	- Indigo Code
